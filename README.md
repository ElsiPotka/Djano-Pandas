## üìã System Requirements

- **Python Version:** 3.13+ (recommended for optimal performance)
- **Memory:** Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large datasets)
- **Storage:** At least 500MB free space
- **Browser:** Modern web browser for Jupyter interface

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Virtual Environment Issues
**Problem:** Virtual environment won't activate
- Verify you're in the correct project directory
- On Windows, ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

### Dependency Installation Problems
**Problem:** Package installation failures
- Ensure virtual environment is active (check command prompt prefix)
- Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Clear pip cache: `pip cache purge`
- Try installing packages individually to isolate issues

### Jupyter Notebook Issues
**Problem:** Notebook won't start or kernel errors
- Restart the virtual environment
- Reinstall Jupyter: `pip uninstall jupyter && pip install jupyter`
- Check for port conflicts: try `jupyter notebook --port=8889`
